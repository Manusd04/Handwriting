# Handwriting
The Handwriting Recognition Project aims to develop a robust system for recognizing handwritten characters using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project focuses on creating an efficient and accurate model that can interpret and transcribe handwritten text into machine-readable formats.
# Handwritten Recognition using CNN

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize handwritten characters. The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten characters and achieves accurate recognition through the power of deep learning.
